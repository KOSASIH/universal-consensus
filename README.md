# universal-consensus

A Git repo for a blockchain platform that aims to provide a universal standard for consensus algorithms, enabling seamless integration and communication between different blockchain networks.

# Universal Consensus

A Blockchain Platform for Universal Consensus Algorithms

## Introduction

Welcome to Universal Consensus, a blockchain platform that aims to provide a universal standard for consensus algorithms, enabling seamless integration and communication between different blockchain networks. Our mission is to create a decentralized, open-source platform that allows blockchain networks to interoperate and share value, creating a more connected and robust blockchain ecosystem.

## What is Universal Consensus?

Universal Consensus is a blockchain-agnostic platform that provides a standardized framework for consensus algorithms, allowing different blockchain networks to communicate and interoperate with each other. Our platform enables the creation of a universal consensus layer that can be used by any blockchain network, regardless of its underlying architecture or consensus mechanism.

## Features

1. Standardized Consensus Framework: A modular, extensible framework for consensus algorithms that allows for seamless integration with different blockchain networks.
2. Interoperability: Enables communication and value transfer between different blockchain networks, creating a more connected and robust blockchain ecosystem.
3. Decentralized Governance: A decentralized governance model that allows stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process and shape the future of the platform.
4. Open-Source: Universal Consensus is an open-source platform, allowing developers to contribute to the codebase and shape the future of the project.
