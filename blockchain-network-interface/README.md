# Blockchain Network Interface

## Overview

The Blockchain Network Interface (BNI) is a critical component of the Universal Consensus platform, providing a standardized interface for interacting with different blockchain networks. This directory contains the implementation of the BNI, which enables seamless communication and value transfer between blockchain networks.

## Components

- `bc_network_interface.py`

This file contains the core implementation of the Blockchain Network Interface. It provides a set of APIs for interacting with blockchain networks, including methods for sending and receiving transactions, querying blockchain state, and more.

- models
- 
This directory contains data models used by the BNI to represent blockchain-specific data structures, such as transactions, blocks, and smart contracts.

- controllers
- 
This directory contains controller classes that implement the business logic for interacting with blockchain networks. These controllers use the APIs provided by bc_network_interface.py to perform tasks such as transaction validation, block verification, and smart contract execution.

- utils

This directory contains utility functions and classes used by the BNI, such as cryptographic functions, data serialization, and error handling.

- tests

This directory contains test cases for the BNI implementation, including unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests.

## Getting Started

To use the Blockchain Network Interface, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Import the BNI module: `import blockchain_network_interface as bni`
3. Create an instance of the BNI: `bni_instance = bni.BlockchainNetworkInterface()`
4. Use the BNI APIs to interact with blockchain networks: `bni_instance.send_transaction(...)`
