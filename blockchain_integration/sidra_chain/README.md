# Sidra Chain Integration

This repository contains the integration of Sidra Chain with the Universal Consensus framework.

## Overview

The Sidra Chain integration provides a decentralized and secure way to interact with the Sidra Chain blockchain. This integration allows for the creation of smart contracts, decentralized applications, and other blockchain-based solutions.

## Features

*   Decentralized and secure interaction with the Sidra Chain blockchain
*   Support for smart contracts and decentralized applications
*   Integration with the Universal Consensus framework

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following directories:

*   `consensus.py`: contains the consensus algorithm implementation
*   `api_integration.py`: contains the API integration implementation
*   `main.py`: contains the main application implementation
*   `smart_contracts`: contains the smart contract implementations
    *   `sidra_usd.py`: contains the Sidra USD smart contract implementation
    *   `sidra_dex.py`: contains the Sidra DEX smart contract implementation
*   `node_selection`: contains the node selection implementation
    *   `dqn.py`: contains the DQN node selection implementation
*   `secure_aggregation`: contains the secure aggregation implementation
    *   `byzantine_fault_tolerance.py`: contains the Byzantine Fault Tolerance implementation
