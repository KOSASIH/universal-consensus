# Architecture

The Sidra Chain integration architecture consists of the following components:

*   Consensus algorithm implementation
*   API integration implementation
*   Smart contract implementations
*   Node selection implementation
*   Secure aggregation implementation

## Consensus Algorithm

The consensus algorithm implementation is responsible for achieving consensus among nodes in the network.

## API Integration

The API integration implementation provides a interface for interacting with the Sidra Chain blockchain.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contract implementations provide decentralized applications and services on the Sidra Chain blockchain.

## Node Selection

The node selection implementation is responsible for selecting nodes to participate in the consensus algorithm.

## Secure Aggregation

The secure aggregation implementation provides a secure way to aggregate data from multiple nodes.
