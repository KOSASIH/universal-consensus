# Sidra Chain Integration Documentation

Welcome to the Sidra Chain integration documentation. This documentation provides an overview of the Sidra Chain integration with the Universal Consensus framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sidra Chain integration, please refer to the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Architecture

The Sidra Chain integration consists of the following components:

*   Consensus algorithm implementation
*   API integration implementation
*   Smart contract implementations
*   Node selection implementation
*   Secure aggregation implementation

## Consensus Algorithm

The consensus algorithm implementation is located in the [consensus.py](consensus.py) file.

### Configuration

The consensus algorithm configuration is located in the [config.json](config.json) file.

### API Integration

The API integration implementation is located in the [api_integration.py](api_integration.py) file.

### Smart Contracts

The smart contract implementations are located in the [smart_contracts](smart_contracts) directory.

#### Sidra USD

The Sidra USD smart contract implementation is located in the [sidra_usd.py](smart_contracts/sidra_usd.py) file.

#### Sidra DEX

The Sidra DEX smart contract implementation is located in the [sidra_dex.py](smart_contracts/sidra_dex.py) file.

### Node Selection

The node selection implementation is located in the [node_selection](node_selection) directory.

#### DQN

The DQN node selection implementation is located in the [dqn.py](node_selection/dqn.py) file.

### Secure Aggregation

The secure aggregation implementation is located in the [secure_aggregation](secure_aggregation) directory.

#### Byzantine Fault Tolerance

The Byzantine Fault Tolerance implementation is located in the [byzantine_fault_tolerance.py](secure_aggregation/byzantine_fault_tolerance.py) file.
